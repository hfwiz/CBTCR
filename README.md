# CBTCR
the code and dataset for CBTCR

#### MBFL-test-reduction-CBTCR-code-extend.py is the code for implementing CBTCR on Defects4J.

#### IJSEKE-CBTCR-analysis-extend.py is the process of experimental data for CBTCR and other techniques.

#### The intermediate data represents the output obtained from running Defects4J.

#### The subject programs used in the experiments are sourced from Defects4Jã€‚


We use the Defects4J from https://github.com/rjust/defects4j.

\* Due to behavioral changes introduced under Java 8, some bugs are no longer
reproducible. Hence, Defects4J distinguishes between active and deprecated bugs:

- Active bugs can be accessed through `active-bugs.csv`.

- Deprecated bugs are removed from `active-bugs.csv`, but their metadata is
  retained in the project directory.

- Deprecated bugs can be accessed through `deprecated-bugs.csv`, which also
  details when and why a bug was deprecated.

We do not re-enumerate active bugs because publications using Defects4J artifacts
usually refer to bugs by their specific bug id.
